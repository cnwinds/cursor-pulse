# Cursor Pulse

Self-hosted control plane and optional MITM data plane for Cursor usage, key loans, and quota routing.

## Language

### Identity

**Member**:
A person in the Pulse ledger, with portal role and optional channel identities.
_Avoid_: User, account (for a person)

**MemberIdentity**:
A login or IM addressing key (`channel` + `external_id`) bound to a Member.

### Credentials & loans

**Proxy Key**:
A Pulse-issued alias (`pk_` / `pka_`) that authorizes the MITM proxy to a pool or loan binding.
_Avoid_: API key (ambiguous with Cursor keys)

**Key Loan**:
A temporary binding of an underlying Cursor credential to a borrower via a loan alias.

### Proxy data plane

**Quota Pool**:
The billing bucket a Cursor request consumes — `auto` or `api` — derived from the model / request shape.
_Avoid_: Pool (alone; ambiguous with the credential list), billing pool (implementation phrase)

**Sticky Credential**:
The pool credential bound to a CLI session JWT for a Quota Pool until that pool is exhausted on that credential, then rotated within pool order.
_Avoid_: Session key, sticky session (overload with HTTP sessions)

**Credential Pool**:
The ordered set of Cursor credentials the MITM may use for non-loan traffic.
_Avoid_: Key pool (when meaning credentials with IDs and per-bucket quota)

**Snapshot Headroom**:
Remaining capacity on a Quota Pool from the latest account snapshot — a percent below 100, or unknown (missing percent counts as usable).
_Avoid_: Remaining cents alone (can disagree with Cursor's percent fields)

**Credential Pool Intake**:
Whether a credential may enter the Credential Pool. Requires Snapshot Headroom on **at least one** Quota Pool (plus burn/coverage filters). Distinct from request-time selection for a **specific** Quota Pool, which may still skip a sticky credential when that bucket is full.
_Avoid_: Exhausted (alone — loan issuance still uses total burn / total_pct)
**Proxy Usage Rollup**:
Account / model / China-calendar-day aggregates over ProxyKeyUsage rows for a Proxy Key or Key Loan.
_Avoid_: Usage analytics (team-wide Cursor sync analytics is a different surface)

**Quota Snapshot Read**:
Newest AccountQuotaSnapshot per account, bulk-loaded for board / lender / Credential Pool Intake.
_Avoid_: Per-account N+1 snapshot queries

**Snapshot Headroom rules**:
Pure OR/AND checks on auto_pct/api_pct used by Credential Pool Intake and mirrored in the Go proxy (`pctQuotaOK` / `snapshotIntakeOK`).
_Avoid_: Embedding these rules only inside burn scoring
